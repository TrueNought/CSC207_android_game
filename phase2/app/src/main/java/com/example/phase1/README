===== PHASE 2 README =====

[No additional setup is required, the game should just work, if it's been cloned properly]

1. When the game is started, it will show a welcome screen. Click past it.

2. There will be an intro animation, which can be skipped if clicked.

3. Once you click on the intro animation, you will enter the save menu. This is the activity where
the save slots are managed.

4. Upon clicking on an empty save slot, you will be taken to a screen to set your character name.

5. Once a name is set, you will be taken to a screen to set the character preferences, where you can
toggle the difficult, character, and day/night preferences.

6. Upon clicking finish, your account will be saved in the slot you clicked on.

7. If you click on the slot you just created, your stats will be displayed. Once you have played a
game, your highscore and the date and time which you achieved it on will also be displayed.

8. Once your save slot is selected, click on the "Begin your adventure!" button to start the game.

9. You will load into level 1, where you will kill monsters and collect items.

10. Once all the monsters have been killed, you can then proceed to level 2.

11. Level 2 will have you jump over obstacles to get points. Once your health runs out, you have a
short amount of time to collect the items that will appear on screen.

12. Level 3 is a "repeat the sequence" game. Buttons on the screen will flash in a random order, and
they must be clicked in the same order to win the game.

13. Once the game is won, you can use the coins you've earned to purchase keys and potions, which
will help in getting a better highscore.
