===== PHASE 2 README =====

[No additional setup is required, the game should just work, if it's been cloned properly]

1. When the game is started, it will show a welcome screen. Click past it.

2. There will be an intro animation, which can be skipped if clicked.

3. Once you click on the intro animation, you will enter the save menu. This is the activity where
the save slots are managed.
